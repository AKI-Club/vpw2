Notes on the Filetable
======================

Extracting Filetable Data
-------------------------
(todo; this probably involves the filetable index, though it can cause issues with
WWF No Mercy...)

ge project's extract script is using:
offset,size,name,compressed,extract

where...
offset is the offset into the z64 rom for this file.
size is the size of the file.
name is the path of the extracted file.
compressed is 0 for false or 1 for true.
extract is 0 for don't extract or 1 for extract.

Building the Filetable
----------------------
Game code references file table indices in the code.
A tool needs to be created to handle this. The preferred way would be to have
said tool generate a header file consisting of #defines of file IDs.

The tool would take a file with entries like this:
identifier,filepath,compressed,exportfilesize

where...
identifier is the define name to be put in the header.
filepath is the path to the file to include.
compressed is either 0 for false or 1 for true. data is compressed with LZSS.
exportfilesize is either 0 for false or 1 for true. xxx: what does the game expect, compressed or uncompressed size?

The generated header file will use "FILEID_identifier" as the symbol format.
If a filesize export is requested, the symbol would be "FILESIZE_identifier".
