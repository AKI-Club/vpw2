Notes on the Filetable
======================

Extracting Filetable Data
-------------------------
This is handled with an ad-hoc tool, "extract_filetable".
The filetable index and data files are passed in as arguments, and all files
are extracted as-is.

Any LZSS'd data will need to be decoded by "aki_lzss" before it becomes editable.
Data will also need to be re-LZSS'd (if necessary) when building the filetable.

Converting Assets
-----------------
The filetable holds most of the game assets that are interesting to edit.
The conversion process consists of two parts:

1) Game-ready data to human-editable
2) Human-editable to game-ready data

Example for converting a TEX file (title screen logo) with n64graphics:
./n64graphics -e 0015.tex -g 0015.png -p 0015.tex -o 0x210 -P 0x10 -f ci8 -w 320 -h 240

However, n64graphics (technically stb_image) seems to ignore palettes,
which is a non-starter for a game that relies on them.

Some asset types require bespoke converters. Currently available tools include:
- akiarc  | AkiArchive format
- akitext | AkiText format
- menubg  | MenuBackground conversion

Building the Filetable
----------------------
Game code references hardcoded file table indices. This becomes a problem if
you want to modify the filetable in any way. Ideally, the tool that builds
the filetable should be responsible for generating a file with #defines of
file IDs. The "akifiletable" program allows for this, as well as definitions
for the assembler and linker. (insert grumbling about current repo state here)

Since file IDs can be used as-is or as the first entry in a series, we can't
automatically generate the identifiers. Most file ID identifiers will start with
"FILEID_*", while sequential base file IDs will be defined as "FILEID_FIRST_*".

If a filesize export is requested, the symbol would be "FILESIZE_identifier".
The game seems to expect the uncompressed size in most cases, with some extra
padding in the remaining instances.

More information on symbol naming schemes can be found in docs/fileid_symbols.txt.
